# Retrospective techniques

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

This technique is based on classifiying things based on how much they
should be done in the future.

A fast retrospective technique lasting about 10 minutes to 25 minutes.
People are asked to give comments on categories: "We should stop doing",
"We should do less", "We should continue doing", "We should do more"
and "We should start doing". These can be organized into 5 sectors of a
circle, hence the name.

## Glad, Sad, Mad

This technique is based on classifying things based on the effect of
those things to the team.

The feedback is divided into Glad, Sad or Mad. Glad means thigs that went
well. Sad and Mad are both negative comments but the distinction is that
Sad referes to negative comments internal to the team while Mad refers
to the external negative things.
